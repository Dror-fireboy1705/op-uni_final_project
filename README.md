# op-uni
Project for a course of the open university.
The project was to make the initial part of an assembler for the "assembly" coding language.

Summery: the assembler recieves a text file of what is assumed to be code made in "assembly". The assembler takes that file as input and outputs a file with summerized data ready for further incoding into binary.
if the code in the input file carries a mistake, the assembler instead outputs a file containing an explanation for the first detected mistake in the code.
